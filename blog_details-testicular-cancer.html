                  <p>
                    When cells in the testicle proliferate and create a tumour,
                    it results in testicular cancer. It is rare. Sperm-producing
                    germ cells are the starting point of more than 90% of
                    testicular cancers. Germ cell tumours (GCTs) come in two
                    varieties. Radiation and chemotherapy work wonders for
                    seminoma growth, which can happen slowly. In addition to
                    growing more quickly, non-seminomas may respond less to
                    those treatments. Different non-seminomas exist: teratoma,
                    embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, and yolk sac tumours.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Rarely, testicular cancers can also develop outside of the
                    germ cells. The testosterone-producing Leydig cells give
                    rise to tumours known as Leydig cell tumours. The Sertoli
                    cells that facilitate sperm growth typically are the source
                    of Sertoli cell tumours. Multiple cell types can be present
                    in testicular tumours.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The treatment will be guided by the type of testicular
                    cancer cell discovered, your symptoms, and other factors.

                    Types of testicular cancers:
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Testicular germ cells that aggregate to form a mass or
                    tumour are responsible for about 90% of cases of testicular
                    cancer. Eventually, germ cells differentiate into sperm.
                    Germ cells are the source of two types of testicular cancer.
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Seminoma:</strong> Slow-growing cancer that mostly
                      strikes adults in their 40s or 50s.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Non-seminoma:</strong> Cancer grows more quickly
                      than seminomas. The age groups most affected are the late
                      teens, early 20s, and early 30s. Tumours other than
                      seminomas fall into four categories. The type of germ cell
                      that constitutes each tumour gives it its name. The
                      following tumour types are not seminomas: choriocarcinoma,
                      teratoma, yolk sac carcinoma, and embryonal carcinoma.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    Some testicular cancer tumours consist of both seminoma and
                    non-seminoma cells.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">
                    Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer:
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Testicular cancer may have no symptoms. A painless swelling,
                    a lump in the testicles, or a change in size or shape are
                    the most typical symptoms.
                  </p>

                  <p>Less frequent symptoms consist of:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Back pain</li>
                    <li>Sense of unevenness</li>
                    <li>Sense of heaviness in the scrotum</li>
                    <li>Swelling of the testicle, with or without pain</li>
                    <li>A pain in the scrotum, testicles, or lower abdomen</li>
                    <li>
                      Men's breast tissue changes or tenderness brought on by
                      hormones produced by cancer cells.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    If you notice any of these symptoms, don't panic—they can
                    also be signs of other conditions. However, just to be sure,
                    make an appointment with your provider. Cancer treatment
                    becomes more difficult when diagnosis is delayed, giving
                    cancer cells more time to spread.
                  </p>

                    Testicular cancer risk factors:
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    The exact cause of testicular cancer is not known, but many
                    risk factors have been identified, such as:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism)</li>
                    <li>Family history of testicular cancer</li>
                    <li>HIV or AIDS</li>
                    <li>Hypospadias</li>
                    <li>
                      If you're previously diagnosed with testicular cancer,
                      there's a higher chance of developing cancer in your other
                      testicle.
                    </li>
                    <li>Age (most common between age 20 and 45).</li>
                    <li>
                      Testicular cancer can strike men of any race or ethnicity,
                      but Caucasian men are four to five times more likely than
                      men of other races to develop the disease for unknown
                      reasons.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Cancer of the testicles cannot be avoided.</p>

                  <p>
                    Testicular cancer does not presently have any recommended
                    screening exams, in contrast to certain other cancers. Once
                    a month, you should examine yourself in a warm shower. See a
                    doctor if you observe any changes in the testicles.
                  </p>

                    Testicular cancer diagnosis:
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    The common methods for diagnosing testicular cancer are
                    listed below.
                  </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Self-examination:</strong> An essential component
                      of early detection for testicular cancer is
                      self-examination. Although quite uncommon, testicular
                      cancer is very treatable, particularly if caught early. By
                      regularly checking yourself, you can get accustomed to the
                      way your testicles feel normally and quickly identify any
                      changes that might be cause for concern.

                      />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Medical History and Physical Examination:</strong>
                      The doctor will take a detailed medical history and ask
                      about any symptoms or risk factors. They will then
                      physically examine the testicles to check for any
                      abnormalities or lumps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Ultrasound scan:</strong> Sound waves are utilised
                      in testicular ultrasound to produce images of the
                      testicles and scrotum without pain. A transparent gel is
                      applied to the scrotum to ensure proper contact, and then
                      the ultrasound probe is moved over the scrotum to capture
                      the images.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>CT (Computed Tomography) Scan:</strong> CT scans
                      can provide detailed cross-sectional images of the abdomen
                      and pelvis, which can help identify if cancer has spread
                      to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Blood test:</strong> Testicular cancer can be
                      identified through a blood test called a tumour marker
                      test. The test looks for specific proteins, such as
                      beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein, and
                      lactate dehydrogenase. However, elevated levels of these
                      markers don't always mean cancer is present. Your
                      healthcare provider needs to conduct further investigation
                      to identify the underlying cause of the abnormality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Staging:</strong> If testicular cancer is
                      confirmed, further tests may be performed to determine the
                      stage of the tumour and whether it has spread to other
                      parts of the body. Staging helps guide the treatment plan.

                    Testicular cancer treatment:
                  </h3>

                  <p>Testicular cancer treatment techniques include:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Surgery:</strong> During a testicular ultrasound,
                      sound waves create images. Images of the testicles and
                      scrotum can be created with it. Stretching your legs
                      apart, you lie on your back for an ultrasound. An MD
                      applies a transparent gel to the vagina. The images are
                      taken by moving a hand-held probe over the scrotum.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> High-energy X-rays or
                      other radiation types are used in radiation therapy to
                      target and destroy cancer cells specifically. It is
                      usually applied to testicular cancers that have spread to
                      lymph nodes or other areas following surgery, such as
                      seminoma. However, their use has decreased recently
                      because alternative treatment options have advanced.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Drugs are administered
                      intravenously (via a vein) or orally as part of this
                      treatment to either kill or prevent cancer cells from
                      expanding. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy can be used
                      separately or together.

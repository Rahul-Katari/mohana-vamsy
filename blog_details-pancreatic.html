                  Treatment</h3>
                <h3 class="details_info_title">What is pancreatic cancer?</h3>
                <p>Pancreatic cancer occurs when pancreatic cells develop mutations and become cancerous (malignant).
                  These abnormal cells multiply uncontrollably, grow to form a mass (tumour), and then spread to other
                  body parts.</p>
                <p>Pancreatic cancer affects the pancreas, which is challenging to identify in its early stages because
                  it can grow for some time before it causes pressure in the stomach or cause any pain sensation.</p>
                <h3 class="details_info_title">What are the pancreas, and what are its normal functions?</h3>
                <p>The pancreas is located behind the stomach in the abdomen and front of the spine. It is an essential
                  organ in our body, performing both endocrine and exocrine functions. It is crucial in maintaining
                  proper digestion and regulating blood sugar levels. It also aids in digestion through the release of
                  digestive enzymes.</p>
                <img src="./assets/images/blogs/blogDetails/pancreas-anotomy.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <h3 class="details_info_title">What are the types of pancreatic cancer?</h3>
                <p>Pancreatic cancer types are divided into two main categories: exocrine pancreatic cancer, which
                  includes adenocarcinoma, and neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Exocrine (non-endocrine) pancreatic cancer: Adenocarcinoma begins in exocrine cells responsible
                      for
                      producing pancreatic enzymes.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer: Begins in endocrine cells responsible for producing hormones.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="details_info_title">What are pancreatic cancer symptoms?</h3>
                <p>Pancreatic cancer symptoms may be changeable, often non-specific, and represent a variety of
                  possibilities besides pancreatic cancer. Characteristically, pale bowel movements, itching, dark
                  urine, and jaundice may indicate the growth of pancreatic cancer. Weight loss, tiredness, loss of
                  appetite, and less energy. Pain may be present if the tumour is advanced.</p>
                <p>Studies have indicated that pancreatic polypeptide is frequently secreted by pancreatic endocrine
                  tumours and is considered a sign of such tumours. Blood clots are strongly linked with pancreatic
                  cancer and can be the initial symptom of the disease.</p>
                <p>The common signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer may include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pain, usually in the abdomen or back</li>
                  <li>Pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas)</li>
                  <li>Weight loss</li>
                  <li>Diarrhea</li>
                  <li>Nausea</li>
                  <li>Jaundice with or without itching</li>
                  <li>Changes in stool</li>
                  <li>Recent-onset diabetes</li>
                  <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="details_info_title">When should I see a doctor?</h3>
                <p>Schedule an appointment with your general practitioner if you have any bothersome, unexplained
                  symptoms. The physician might suggest a few diagnostic tests to rule out pancreatic cancer in addition
                  to other medical issues. You will be referred to an oncologist or gastroenterologist for further
                  pancreatic cancer treatment if the cancer is confirmed.</p>
                <h3 class="details_info_title">What are the causes of pancreatic cancer?</h3>
                <p>Pancreatic cancer occurs due to alterations in the DNA; it can happen slowly or be inherited from
                  your parents. The changes that occur over time may result from exposure to harmful factors or a random
                  process.</p>
                <p>The actual cause of pancreatic cancer is unclear. Nearly ten per cent of pancreatic cancer cases are
                  believed to be inherited or familial. Cancer may appear at any time, but smoking, obesity, and old age
                  increase the risk of getting it.</p>
                <img src="./assets/images/blogs/blogDetails/pancreatic-cancer-development.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <h3 class="details_info_title">Which factors increase the risk of pancreatic cancer?</h3>
                <p>The pancreatic cancer risk factors are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Smoking</li>
                  <li>Obesity</li>
                  <li>Old age</li>
                  <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
                  <li>Excess alcohol consumption</li>
                  <li>Male gender</li>
                  <li>Liver Cirrhosis</li>
                  <li>Pancreatitis (Chronic inflammation of the pancreas)</li>
                  <li>Family history of pancreatic cancer</li>
                  <li>Family history of DNA mutations that can raise the risk of cancer</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="details_info_title">How to prevent pancreatic cancer?</h3>
                <p>Pancreatic cancer cannot be completely avoided, but it’s possible to avoid its risk factors, like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Quit smoking</li>
                  <li>Maintain healthy weight</li>
                  <li>Exercise regularly</li>
                  <li>Avoid excess alcohol consumption</li>
                  <li>Stay away from toxic chemicals, especially at your workplace</li>
                  <li>Keep diabetes under control</li>
                  <li>Get regular health check-ups</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="details_info_title">What are pancreatic cancer diagnostic tests?</h3>
                <p>Detecting pancreatic cancer can be challenging during the initial stages. If your healthcare provider
                  thinks you might have pancreatic cancer, they might ask you to take some tests to look at your
                  pancreas. These tests will help them see if there are any signs of cancer.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Blood tests:</strong> A blood test for the pancreas can identify tumour markers. The
                    chemical substances released by cancer are known as tumour markers. High levels of carbohydrate
                    antigen (CA) 19-9, a marker detects pancreatic cancer.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="./assets/images/blogs/blogDetails/pancreatic-cancer-test.png" alt="">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Abdomen ultrasound:</strong> An ultrasound scan uses sound waves to make pictures of the
                    blood vessels and organs in your abdomen. The ultrasound scan of the abdomen shows abnormal growth
                    (pancreatic tumour) and changes, including blood flow.</li>
                  <li><strong>Computerised tomography (CT) scan:</strong> A CT scan is an imaging test that accurately
                    pictures organs inside the body. It is helpful in diagnosing pancreatic cancer and its spread to
                    surrounding organs.</li>
                  <li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan:</strong> MRI scans produce precise images of body
                    parts using radio waves and magnets instead of X-rays. Advanced MRI scans can also be used to
                    monitor pancreatic cancer, such as MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and MR angiography (MRA).</li>
                  <li><strong>Positron emission tomography (PET) scan:</strong> A PET scan is a diagnostic imaging
                    technique that uses radiotracers to examine metabolic processes in the body. It can analyze changes
                    in blood flow, metabolism, and regional chemical composition. PET scans are an effective tool for
                    evaluating the degree of pancreatic cancer progression.</li>
                  <li><strong>Endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS):</strong> Endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) is a
                    minimally invasive test that uses endoscopy and ultrasound. It examines the area around your
                    pancreas, stomach, and nearby lymph nodes. Doctors do it to check for pancreatic cancer and see how
                    big it is. They also check if it has spread nearby.</li>
                  <li><strong>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP):</strong> ERCP is a procedure that
                    uses X-rays and an upper GI endoscopy to diagnose and treat liver, bile, gall bladder, and
                    pancreatic duct problems. It could be used to learn more about pancreatitis or liver, pancreas, or
                    bile duct cancer.</li>
                  <li><strong>Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC):</strong> This procedure helps doctors see
                    the bile ducts to find blockages. It can help to diagnose pancreatic tumours as they can be one of
                    the reasons for bile duct obstruction.</li>
                  <li><strong>Laparoscopy:</strong> It is a surgical operation using small incisions to access the
                    inside of your abdomen and pelvis. Doctors perform this test to confirm if someone has pancreatic
                    cancer and to check if it has metastasized.</li>
                  <li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> A biopsy is when doctors take a small piece of tissue to check if it's
                    cancerous. During certain medical procedures like EUS, ERCP, or laparoscopy, a tiny tool attached to
                    the endoscope can collect cells for a biopsy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="details_info_title">What are the pancreatic cancer treatments?</h3>
                <p>Treatment for pancreatic cancer is based on the patient's age, overall health, and the tumour's kind,
                  size, and extent. Pancreas cancer is often complicated to treat because it's often discovered too
                  late. Pancreatic cancer is curable if detected early on before it has metastasized to other organs.
                </p>
                <p>Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery are the treatments used to treat pancreatic cancer.
                  Three types of curative surgeries are commonly done to treat pancreatic cancer disease; they are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple Procedure)</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Distal pancreatectomy</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Total pancreatectomy</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy): With radiation therapy, cancer cells are destroyed, or
                  tumour growth is inhibited by using high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation. To reduce tumour
                  size before surgery, some patients receive radiation therapy. Three types of radiotherapy are mainly
                  used to treat pancreatic cancer: external beam therapy (EBT), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT),
                  and proton therapy.</p>
                <p>Chemotherapy: Drugs are administered intravenously (via a vein) or orally as part of this treatment
                  to either kill or prevent cancer cells from expanding. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy can be used
                  separately or together.</p>
                <p>Cancers of the endocrine pancreas are sometimes minor, and no treatment is necessary. However, they
                  can provoke a serious hormonal disorder that has to be treated.</p>
                <p>Similar to all cancers, treatment for pancreatic cancer uses the latest technologies. Various imaging
                  techniques, including intravenous pyelogram (IVP), ultrasound scan, computerized tomography (CT)
                  scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provide very detailed images of the pancreas, uncovering
                  masses and allowing physicians to tailor treatment options and recommendations precisely.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>1. What is pancreatic cancer disease?</strong><br>
                    Pancreatic cancer is when cancer cells grow in an uncontrolled manner and form masses or tumours in
                    the pancreas. Tumours can impair the pancreas's ability to function, producing pain and other
                    symptoms.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>2. How to prevent pancreatic cancer?</strong><br>
                    Although it is not possible to completely prevent pancreatic cancer, it is possible to lower the
                    risk by avoiding pancreatic cancer risk factors. On rare occasions, precancerous lesions can be
                    found and removed early to stop the development of pancreatic cancer.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>3. What are the pancreatic cancer symptoms?</strong><br>
                    Early-stage pancreatic cancer does not have any particular symptoms. Still, you should consult your
                    healthcare provider if you experience stomach pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin), or
                    unintentional weight loss.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>4. Can pancreatic cancer patients make a full recovery?</strong><br>
                    Yes, pancreatic cancer patients can make a full recovery.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>5. Is it possible to survive without the pancreas?</strong><br>
                    It is possible to survive without a pancreas, but you will develop diabetes and need to take insulin
                    regularly. To aid in food digestion, you will also need to take enzyme supplements.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>6. What is meant by islet cell cancer?</strong><br>
                    It is a rare type of pancreatic cancer originating in the cells making insulin and other hormones.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>7. Which doctor treats pancreatic cancer disease?</strong><br>
                    An oncologist and gastroenterologist treat pancreatic cancer disease.
                  </li>
                </ul>

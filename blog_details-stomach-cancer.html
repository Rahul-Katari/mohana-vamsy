                  <p>
                    Gastric cancer, or stomach cancer, begins in the stomach.
                    Stomach cancer is still one of the most common cancers
                    globally despite a notable decline in incidence over the
                    last 20 years. The most prevalent kind, adenocarcinoma,
                    originates from the stomach's inner lining. Other forms,
                    though comparatively uncommon, originate from the middle or
                    outer regions of the stomach.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">Stomach cancer symptoms:</h3>

                  <p>
                    Early-stage stomach cancer may not exhibit any symptoms.
                    Some common symptoms of stomach cancer include fatigue, mild
                    abdominal pain, and early satiety (feeling full).

                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Schedule an appointment with your general practitioner if
                    you experience unusual or persistent symptoms; they may
                    recommend diagnostic tests. If a tumour is detected, you
                    will be referred to a gastroenterologist and oncologist to
                    provide appropriate treatment options for stomach cancer.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">Causes of stomach cancer</h3>

                  <p>
                    Stomach cancer is a malignant disease that arises from the
                    cells in the lining of the stomach. The exact cause of these
                    changes in the cells is still unknown. Cancer originates
                    from a genetic mutation in the DNA structure of cells, which
                    can disrupt the normal process of cell division, leading to
                    uncontrolled growth. As a result, an abnormal mass or lump
                    of tissue, known as a tumour, forms in the stomach.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">Stomach cancer diagnosis:</h3>

                  <p>
                    To diagnose stomach cancer, your healthcare provider will
                    take your medical history, conduct a physical exam, and
                    order tests such as imaging, blood tests, or a biopsy.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Here is an overview of the steps involved in diagnosing
                    stomach cancer:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Blood Tests: Blood tests can be performed to evaluate
                      overall health, organ functions and check for
                      abnormalities in blood count.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Imaging Tests:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Upper Endoscopy (Gastroscopy): To view the stomach
                          lining, an endoscope—a thin, flexible tube with a
                          camera on the end—is placed through your mouth and
                          into your stomach.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Barium Swallow or Upper GI Series: You swallow a
                          barium contrast solution, which is then visualised on
                          X-rays to highlight abnormalities in the upper
                          digestive tract.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS): This combines endoscopy
                          with ultrasound to provide detailed images of the
                          stomach lining and nearby structures.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Radiologic tests such as CT scan, barium swallow, MRI
                          scan, and PET scan can help detect cancer and related
                          abnormalities. These tests provide detailed
                          information about the tumour and are essential in
                          diagnosing and treating cancer.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Biopsy: A biopsy is the definitive way to confirm the
                      presence of cancer. During an endoscopy or EUS, a small
                      tissue sample (biopsy) is taken from suspicious areas in
                      the stomach lining.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Staging: Staging is crucial for stomach cancer treatment
                      decisions and prognosis. It includes imaging tests to
                      evaluate the extent of the disease beyond the stomach.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">Stomach cancer treatment:</h3>

                  <p>
                    Treatment is based on your health, treatment preferences,
                    and the extent to which your cancer has spread.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Surgery:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Upper endoscopy: In the early stages, the cancer can be
                      removed from your stomach through an upper endoscopy if
                      it's limited to the superficial layers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Gastrectomy: Once the cancer has spread beyond the outer
                      layers of the stomach, surgery is necessary to remove part
                      or all of the stomach. Subtotal gastrectomy eliminates the
                      section of the stomach affected by cancer, while total
                      gastrectomy removes the whole stomach.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Other treatments:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> It also known as
                      radiotherapy, is a common cancer treatment that uses high
                      radiation doses to kill cancer or malignant cells and
                      reduce the size of tumours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Drugs are administered
                      intravenously (via a vein) or orally as part of this
                      treatment to either kill or prevent cancer cells from
                      expanding. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy can be used
                      separately or together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target therapy:</strong> Target therapy targets
                      the genes and proteins associated with that particular
                      cancer, stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells
                      while causing minimal damage to healthy, normal cells. The
                      most typical adverse effects include fatigue, diarrhoea,
                      and rash.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> The body's immune system
                      is utilised to recognise and fight cancer cells, a form of
                      cancer treatment. Immunotherapy boosts your immune
                      system's capacity to combat cancer cells, utilising the
                      body's natural defences against the disease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Palliative care:</strong> Palliative care for
                      stomach cancer plays a vital role in improving the quality
                      of life for individuals diagnosed with this disease,
                      mainly when the cancer is in advanced stages or not
                      responding to curative treatment. Palliative care for
                      stomach cancer focuses on providing holistic support and
                      symptom management to alleviate suffering and improve the
                      patient's overall well-being.

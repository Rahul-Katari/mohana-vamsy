                  <p>
                    When unhealthy cells in the ovaries start to multiply
                    uncontrollably, it can lead to ovarian cancer and ultimately
                    develop into a tumour. Cancer cells slowly spread into the
                    surrounding tissues if not detected early. They could
                    disperse to different body parts.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">Ovarian Tumour Types</h3>
                  <p>
                    Ovarian tumours are classified into three types based on the
                    tissue of origin:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Epithelial cell tumours:</strong> The cells
                      covering the ovary's surface give rise to these tumours.
                      Most ovarian tumours are epithelial cell tumours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Germ cell tumours:</strong> These tumours
                      originate from the cells that produce the eggs in the
                      ovary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Stromal cell tumours:</strong> These tumours grow
                      in the ovary's structural tissue cells that are in charge
                      of generating female hormones.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Most ovarian tumours are benign, meaning they are not
                    cancerous. When treating benign ovarian tumours, medical
                    professionals may decide to remove the entire ovary or the
                    portion containing the tumour.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">
                    Extra-ovarian Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma (EOPPC)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Epithelial ovarian cancer and EOPPC are closely related
                    cancers. Its microscopic characteristics, prognosis, and
                    national medical history are all the same as those of
                    epithelial ovarian cancer. It takes place in the peritoneum,
                    the lining of the abdomen, outside of the ovary (belly).
                    Women who have had their ovaries removed may still develop
                    this type of cancer because it happens outside the ovary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    EOPPC can cause an increase in the tumour marker CA-125 and
                    mimic the symptoms of ovarian cancer. Treatment consists of
                    surgery and chemotherapy, the same as for ovarian cancer.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">Ovarian Cancer Symptoms</h3>
                  <p>
                    Many signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer are similar to
                    those of other medical conditions. Understanding what is
                    typical for you and paying attention to your body is
                    crucial. These are the most common symptoms and signs of
                    ovarian cancer. Symptoms may vary from person to person.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Lower abdominal pain, including any or all of the
                      following:
                    </li>
                    <li>Having bloated or swollen feelings</li>
                    <li>
                      A decrease in hunger or a filled feeling even after a
                      small meal
                    </li>
                    <li>Nausea, indigestion, and gas</li>
                    <li>Diarrhea, constipation or frequent urination</li>
                    <li>Frequent fatigue</li>
                    <li>Vaginal bleeding</li>
                    <li>
                      Accumulation of fluid around the lungs, which could result
                      in breathlessness
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    It is advisable to consult a physician if these symptoms are
                    new, occur nearly daily, or persist for several weeks. Many
                    times, ovarian cancer does not show symptoms until it has
                    progressed to the point where it has spread outside of the
                    original ovary. Always get a diagnosis from your physician.

                    Schedule an appointment with your general practitioner if
                    you experience unusual or persistent symptoms; they may
                    recommend diagnostic tests. If a cancer is detected, you
                    will be referred to a Gynecologic oncologist or oncologist
                    to provide appropriate treatment options for ovarian cancer.

                    Ovarian cancer has no known cause. However, there are a few
                    risk factors that can increase a woman's chances of getting
                    cancer. Risk factors include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Age (over the age of 55)</li>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">Ovarian Cancer Prevention</h3>
                  <p>
                    A preventative strategy for ovarian cancer is unknown.
                    Still, studies have indicated that women can reduce their
                    risk by taking proactive steps.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Consuming a healthy diet</li>

                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3 class="details_info_title">Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis</h3>
                  <p>
                    A healthcare provider takes a medical history and conducts a
                    pelvic exam to diagnose a medical condition of the
                    reproductive system. The exam checks the vagina, rectum, and
                    lower abdomen for any issues. The exam is conducted with
                    sensitivity to ensure patient comfort and privacy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The doctor might also prescribe additional tests, such as:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Abdomen Ultrasound:</strong> An ultrasound scan
                      uses sound waves to make pictures of the blood vessels and
                      organs in your abdomen. The ultrasound scan of the abdomen
                      shows abnormal growth and changes, including blood flow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Computed Tomography (CT or CAT Scan):</strong>
                      This noninvasive diagnostic imaging technique creates
                      horizontal or axial images (often called slices) of the
                      body using computer technology and X-rays. The CT scan
                      could detect enlarged lymph nodes, indicating a cancer or
                      infection spreading.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Blood Test:</strong> This is used to measure a
                      blood component known as CA-125, a tumour marker that is
                      frequently detected to be elevated in the blood of female
                      ovarian cancer patients. It is more regularly employed to
                      track how well a treatment is working. Since non-cancerous
                      conditions can raise levels, it is not a screening test.

                  <p>
                    Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment
                    specific to your ovarian cancer based on:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Overall health and medical history</li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> Also known as
                      radiotherapy, is a common cancer treatment that uses high
                      radiation doses to kill cancer or malignant cells and
                      reduce the size of tumours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Chemotherapy uses powerful
                      cancer drugs to fight cancer cells by restricting their
                      growth, division, and reproduction. It is an effective
                      systemic treatment that can target cancer cells in various
                      body parts, making it suitable for many types of cancer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target therapy:</strong> Target therapy targets
                      the genes and proteins associated with that particular
                      cancer, stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells
                      while causing minimal damage to healthy, normal cells. The
                      most typical adverse effects include fatigue, diarrhoea,
                      and rash.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Hormone therapy:</strong> Some types of ovarian
                      cancer rely on hormones to grow. Hormone therapy has the
                      potential to reduce or stop the growth of cancers.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                    After completing ovarian cancer treatment, you'll have
                    follow-up appointments to check for any recurrence. Your
                    healthcare provider may perform a thorough exam and order CT
                    scans to monitor your health. Report any symptoms to your
                    provider promptly.
